This is procedure followed for compiling kernel enabled with MPTCP. 
The kernel is locally built on rpi3 board running ubuntu mate 16.04

1) Extract the tar ball linux-rpi-4.1.y_MPTCP.tar.gz using command
	
	tar -xvf linux-rpi-4.1.y_MPTCP.tar.gz

2) Configure the kernel:

For configuring the kernel, either you should modify old .config file by enabling MPTCP and other configuration (as specified in <https://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/DoItYourself>) or use the config file 'mptcp_config' that is uploaded along with the kernel tar ball.
There are two ways of doing this. (Prefer simple method)

Simple method: 

Copy the mptcp_config file into the kernel folder as .config file 
	
	cd linux-rpi-4.1.y
	cp ../mptcp_config .config

Full_configuration method:
	
	sudo apt-get install -y libncurses5-dev
	cd linux-rpi-4.1.y
	make mptcp_defconfig
	make menuconfig

A configuration GUI opens. Save the configuration and exit

3) Build and install the kernel, modules, and Device Tree blobs; this step takes a long time. Get into the directory of kernel folder 

   Run the following commands one after the other

	make -j4 zImage modules dtbs
	sudo make modules_install 
	sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/ 
	sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/ 
	sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/

4) Before executing the below command, it is better to save the old kernel7.img file in /boot folder by renaming it as kernel7-old.img.
	sudo mv /boot/kernel7.img /boot/kernel7-old.img

Now install the new kernel by running the command

	sudo scripts/mkknlimg arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img

REBOOT the rpi3 board to load new kernel
